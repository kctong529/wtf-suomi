# WTF, suomi!

This repository documents my journey of seriously mastering the Finnish language. It's equal parts learning log, study notes, and resource collection. I'm building on basic Finnish exposure and documenting the path from intermediate confusion to (hopefully) actual fluency.

**Assumed starting point**: You've encountered Finnish before, know basic pronunciation rules, and have some grasp of fundamental grammar concepts (like the existence of cases). This isn't a complete beginner's guide.

**Why "wtf-suomi"?** Because anyone who's learned Finnish knows that feeling. But also because underneath the initial confusion lies a beautifully logical language that's worth the effort.

## Repository Philosophy

- **Repetition-heavy approach**: Concepts and vocabulary are revisited multiple times until they become automatic
- **Progressive building**: Master each level thoroughly before advancing
- **Commit early, commit often**: Document the learning process as it happens, not when it's "perfect"
- **Practical focus**: Grammar and vocabulary that actually appears in daily Finnish life
- **Community resource**: Structured so others can follow the same path or cherry-pick what's useful

## Learning Approach

**Phase 1: Systematic Foundation (Current)**
- Structured textbook work with heavy repetition and consolidation
- Revisiting and solidifying grammar patterns until they stick
- Aggressive vocabulary review and active recall practice
- Building automaticity in basic structures before moving forward

**Phase 2: Real-world Integration**
- YLE news articles with vocabulary extraction
- Finnish TV series with detailed notes
- Podcasts for listening comprehension

**Phase 3: Advanced Application**
- Complex texts and media
- Writing practice
- Speaking/conversation practice
